#~ " of volumes and the associated problems of partitions, provisioning, wasted "
#~ "bandwidth, and stranded storage. Thousands of filesystems can draw from a "

#~ "restrictions on which drives can fail."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Dataset:** once a pool is created, it can be divided into datasets. A "
#~ "dataset is similar to a folder in that it supports permissions. A dataset is"
#~ " also similar to a filesystem in that you can set properties such as quotas "
#~ "and compression."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Snapshot:** a read-only point-in-time copy of a filesystem. Snapshots can "
#~ "be created quickly and, if little data changes, new snapshots take up very "
#~ "little space. For example, a snapshot where no files have changed takes 0MB "
#~ "of storage, but if you change a 10GB file it will keep a copy of both the "
#~ "old and the new 10GB version. Snapshots provide a clever way of keeping a "
#~ "history of files, should you need to recover an older copy or even a deleted"
#~ " file. For this reason, many administrators take snapshots often (e.g. every"
#~ " 15 minutes), store them for a period of time (e.g. for a month), and store "
#~ "them on another system. Such a strategy allows the administrator to roll the"
#~ " system back to a specific time or, if there is a catastrophic loss, an off-"
#~ "site snapshot can restore the system up to the last snapshot interval (e.g. "
#~ "within 15 minutes of the data loss). Snapshots can be cloned or rolled back,"

#~ "**Clone:** a writable copy of a snapshot which can only be created on the "
#~ "same ZFS volume. Clones provide an extremely space-efficient way to store "
#~ "many copies of mostly-shared data such as workspaces, software "
#~ "installations, and diskless clients. Clones do not inherit the properties of"
#~ " the parent dataset, but rather inherit the properties based on where the "
#~ "clone is created in the ZFS pool. Because a clone initially shares all its "
#~ "disk space with the original snapshot, its used property is initially zero. "

#~ " a temporary storage area for sync writes until they are written "
#~ "asynchronously to the ZFS pool. If the system has many sync writes, such as "
#~ "from a database server, performance can be increased by adding a dedicated "
#~ "log device known as a SLOG (Secondary LOG). If the system has few sync "
#~ "writes, a SLOG will not speed up writes. When creating a dedicated log "
#~ "device, it is recommended to use a fast SSD with a supercapacitor or a bank "
#~ "of capacitors that can handle writing the contents of the SSD's RAM to the "
#~ "SSD. If you decide to create a dedicated log device, the SSD should be half "
#~ "the size of system RAM as anything larger than that is unused capacity. Note"
#~ " that a dedicated log device can not be shared between ZFS pools and that "
#~ "the same device cannot hold both a log and a cache device."

#~ "**L2ARC:** ZFS uses a RAM cache to reduce read latency. If an SSD is "

#~ " a cache device will not improve a system with too little RAM and will "
#~ "actually decrease performance as ZFS uses RAM to track the contents of "
#~ "L2ARC. RAM is always faster than disks, so always add as much RAM as "
#~ "possible before determining if the system would benefit from a L2ARC device."
#~ " If you have a lot of applications that do large amounts of random reads on "
#~ "a dataset small enough to fit into the L2ARC, read performance may be "
#~ "increased by adding a dedicated cache device. SSD cache devices only help if"
