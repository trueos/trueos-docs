#~ "The lumina-i18n package provides localization files. Once installed, this "
#~ "allows customization of the locale used for the various items listed in "
#~ ":numref:`Figure %s: Session Locale Tab <lumina21c>`. To install this package"
#~ " on a TrueOS® or FreeBSD system, use :command:`sudo pkg install lumina-"
#~ "i18n`. On other operating systems, use the software management tool that "
#~ "comes with the operating system. Since each setting has its own drop-down "
#~ "menu, you have the flexibility to select different locales for each item "
#~ "shown in this screen. If any changes are made in the \"Locale\" tab, click "
#~ ":guilabel:`Save Changes` and restart Lumina so the configured locales can be"
#~ " loaded."

#~ "This new drop-down menu can be used to temporarily change the locale for the"
