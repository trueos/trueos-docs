#~ "bandwidth, and stranded storage. Thousands of filesystems can draw from a "

#~ "**Dataset:** Once a pool is created, it can be divided into datasets. A "

#~ " similar to a filesystem since properties such as quotas and compression can"
#~ " be set."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Snapshot:** A read-only, point-in-time copy of a filesystem. Snapshots can"
#~ " be created quickly and, if little data changes, new snapshots take up very "
#~ "little space. For example, a snapshot where no files have changed takes 0 MB"
#~ " of storage, but if a 10 GB file is changed, it will keep a copy of both the"
#~ " old and the new 10 GB version. Snapshots provide a clever way of keeping a "
#~ "history of files, should an older copy or even a deleted file need to be "
#~ "recovered. For this reason, many administrators take snapshots often (e.g. "
#~ "every 15 minutes), store them for a period of time (e.g. for a month), and "
#~ "store them on another system. Such a strategy allows the administrator to "
#~ "roll the system back to a specific time or, if there is a catastrophic loss,"
#~ " an off-site snapshot can restore the system up to the last snapshot "
#~ "interval (e.g. within 15 minutes of the data loss). Snapshots can be cloned "
#~ "or rolled back, but the files on the snapshot can not be accessed "
#~ "independently."

#~ "**Clone:** A writable copy of a snapshot which can only be created on the "
#~ "same ZFS volume. Clones provide an extremely space-efficient way to store "
#~ "many copies of mostly-shared data such as workspaces, software "
#~ "installations, and diskless clients. Clones do not inherit the properties of"
#~ " the parent dataset, but rather inherit the properties based on where the "

#~ "**ZIL:** A filesystem journal that manages writes. The ZIL is a temporary "
#~ "storage area for sync writes until they are written asynchronously to the "
#~ "ZFS pool. If the system has many sync writes, such as from a database "
#~ "server, performance can be increased by adding a dedicated log device known "
#~ "as a SLOG (Secondary LOG). If the system has few sync writes, a SLOG will "
#~ "not speed up writes. When creating a dedicated log device, it is recommended"
#~ " to use a fast SSD with a supercapacitor or a bank of capacitors that can "
#~ "handle writing the contents of the SSD's RAM to the SSD. If a dedicated log "
#~ "device is needed, the SSD should be half the size of system RAM, as anything"
#~ " larger is unused capacity. Note a dedicated log device can not be shared "
#~ "between ZFS pools and the same device cannot hold both a log and a cache "
#~ "device."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**L2ARC:** ZFS uses a RAM cache to reduce read latency. If an SSD is "
#~ "dedicated as a cache device, it is known as an L2ARC and ZFS uses it to "
#~ "store more reads which can increase random read performance. However, adding"
#~ " a cache device will not improve a system with too little RAM and will "
#~ "actually decrease performance, as ZFS uses RAM to track the contents of "
#~ "L2ARC. RAM is always faster than disks, so always add as much RAM as "
#~ "possible before determining if the system would benefit from a L2ARC device."
#~ " If a lot of applications do large amounts of random reads on a dataset "
#~ "small enough to fit into the L2ARC, read performance may be increased by "
#~ "adding a dedicated cache device. SSD cache devices only help if the working "
#~ "set is larger than system RAM, but small enough that a significant "

#~ "**Pool:** a collection of devices that provides physical storage and data "
#~ "replication managed by ZFS. This pooled storage model eliminates the concept"
#~ " of volumes and the associated problems of partitions, provisioning, wasted "
#~ "bandwidth, and stranded storage. Thousands of filesystems can draw from a "
#~ "common storage pool, each one consuming only as much space as it actually "
#~ "needs. The combined I/O bandwidth of all devices in the pool is available to"
#~ " all filesystems at all times. The `Storage Pools Recommendations "
#~ "<http://www.solarisinternals.com/wiki/index.php/ZFS_Best_Practices_Guide#ZFS_Storage_Pools_Recommendations>`_"
#~ " of the ZFS Best Practices Guide provides detailed recommendations for "
#~ "creating the storage pool."

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Mirror:** a form of RAID where all data is mirrored onto two or more "
#~ "disks, creating a redundant copy should a disk fail."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**RAIDZ:** ZFS software solution that is equivalent to RAID5 in that it "
#~ "allows one disk to fail without losing data. Requires a minimum of 3 disks."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**RAIDZ2:** double-parity ZFS software solution that is similar to RAID6 in "
#~ "that it allows two disks to fail without losing data. Requires a minimum of "
#~ "4 disks."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**RAIDZ3:** triple-parity ZFS software solution. RAIDZ3 offers three parity "
#~ "drives and can operate in degraded mode if up to three drives fail with no "
#~ "restrictions on which drives can fail."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Dataset:** once a pool is created, it can be divided into datasets. A "
#~ "dataset is similar to a folder in that it supports permissions. A dataset is"
#~ " also similar to a filesystem in that you can set properties such as quotas "
#~ "and compression."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Snapshot:** a read-only point-in-time copy of a filesystem. Snapshots can "
#~ "be created quickly and, if little data changes, new snapshots take up very "
#~ "little space. For example, a snapshot where no files have changed takes 0MB "
#~ "of storage, but if you change a 10GB file it will keep a copy of both the "
#~ "old and the new 10GB version. Snapshots provide a clever way of keeping a "
#~ "history of files, should you need to recover an older copy or even a deleted"
#~ " file. For this reason, many administrators take snapshots often (e.g. every"
#~ " 15 minutes), store them for a period of time (e.g. for a month), and store "
#~ "them on another system. Such a strategy allows the administrator to roll the"
#~ " system back to a specific time or, if there is a catastrophic loss, an off-"
#~ "site snapshot can restore the system up to the last snapshot interval (e.g. "
#~ "within 15 minutes of the data loss). Snapshots can be cloned or rolled back,"
#~ " but the files on the snapshot can not be accessed independently."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Clone:** a writable copy of a snapshot which can only be created on the "
#~ "same ZFS volume. Clones provide an extremely space-efficient way to store "
#~ "many copies of mostly-shared data such as workspaces, software "
#~ "installations, and diskless clients. Clones do not inherit the properties of"
#~ " the parent dataset, but rather inherit the properties based on where the "
#~ "clone is created in the ZFS pool. Because a clone initially shares all its "
#~ "disk space with the original snapshot, its used property is initially zero. "
#~ "As changes are made to the clone, it uses more space."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**ZIL:** is effectively a filesystem journal that manages writes. The ZIL is"
#~ " a temporary storage area for sync writes until they are written "
#~ "asynchronously to the ZFS pool. If the system has many sync writes, such as "
#~ "from a database server, performance can be increased by adding a dedicated "
#~ "log device known as a SLOG (Secondary LOG). If the system has few sync "
#~ "writes, a SLOG will not speed up writes. When creating a dedicated log "
#~ "device, it is recommended to use a fast SSD with a supercapacitor or a bank "
#~ "of capacitors that can handle writing the contents of the SSD's RAM to the "
#~ "SSD. If you decide to create a dedicated log device, the SSD should be half "
#~ "the size of system RAM as anything larger than that is unused capacity. Note"
#~ " that a dedicated log device can not be shared between ZFS pools and that "
#~ "the same device cannot hold both a log and a cache device."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**L2ARC:** ZFS uses a RAM cache to reduce read latency. If an SSD is "
#~ "dedicated as a cache device, it is known as an L2ARC and ZFS uses it to "
#~ "store more reads which can increase random read performance. However, adding"
#~ " a cache device will not improve a system with too little RAM and will "
#~ "actually decrease performance as ZFS uses RAM to track the contents of "
#~ "L2ARC. RAM is always faster than disks, so always add as much RAM as "
#~ "possible before determining if the system would benefit from a L2ARC device."
#~ " If you have a lot of applications that do large amounts of random reads on "
#~ "a dataset small enough to fit into the L2ARC, read performance may be "
#~ "increased by adding a dedicated cache device. SSD cache devices only help if"
#~ " your working set is larger than system RAM, but small enough that a "
#~ "significant percentage of it will fit on the SSD. Note that a dedicated "
#~ "L2ARC device can not be shared between ZFS pools."
